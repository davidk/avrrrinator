# avrrrinator

These are the Eagle source files for the Avrrrinator, a Bus Pirate 3 to AVR ISP adapter. 

### Which should I choose?


#### [Avrrrinator Rev. A](hardware/revA)

Straight Bus Pirate to AVR breakout with 5v/3.3v selection. No logic level
translation. Simple and works.

#### Avrrrinator Rev. B

Soon (ETA: when Half Life 3 is released). You probably don't want to wait for this. Mostly for very specific use cases.
