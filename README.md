# avrrrinator

These are the Eagle source files for the Avrrrinator, a Bus Pirate 3 to AVR ISP adapter. 

### Which should I choose?

#### Avrrrinator Rev. A

Straight Bus Pirate to AVR breakout with 5v/3.3v selection. No logic level
translation. Simple and works.

#### Avrrrinator Rev. B

To be announced (ETA: when Half Life 3 is released).
